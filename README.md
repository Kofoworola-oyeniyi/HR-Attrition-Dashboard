# HR-Attrition-Dashboard
In this project, I analysed the effect of different parameters like job satisfaction and job distance on the attrition rate of staff.


Employee retention remains a major challenge for many organisations. High attrition not only increases recruitment and training costs but also disrupts productivity and team stability.

This project explores what truly drives employee attrition by analysing HR data and uncovering patterns behind why employees leave.

In creating this dashboard, I examined how multiple factors influence retention, including home distance, age, gender, promotion history, job role, performance rating, and educational background.

**Key Questions Explored**
i. Are employees who live farther from work more likely to leave?
ii. Does attrition vary across age groups and genders?
iii. How do promotion rates impact employee loyalty?
iv. Which job roles experience the highest attrition, and why?
v. Does performance level influence an employee’s likelihood to exit?
vi. Are certain educational backgrounds more prone to attrition?

**Why This Matters**
This project demonstrates how data-driven insights can help organisations proactively identify retention risks and design targeted HR strategies. Rather than reacting to employee exits, businesses can use analytics to predict, prevent, and plan.
