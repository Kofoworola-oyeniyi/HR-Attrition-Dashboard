# HR-Attrition-Dynamic-Dashboard
### Project Overview
Employee retention remains a major challenge for many organisations. High attrition rates not only increase recruitment and training costs but also disrupt work flow and team stability. In this project, I analysed the effect of different parameters like home distance, age, gender, promotion history, job role, performance rating, and educational background on the attrition rate of staff.

### Data Sources
The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "HR_Dataset.xlsx" file, containing  2,925 employee records with variables on demographics, job roles, performance, compensation, and work conditions, used to analyze employee attrition and retention.

### Tools
- **Excel** - Data Cleaning and Visualisation

### Data Cleaning and Preparation
In the data preparation phase, I performed the following tasks;
1. Data loading and Inspection
2. Handling errors
3. Data formating and Normalization

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This involved exploring the data to answer the following **key** questions;
- Are employees who live farther from work more likely to leave?
- Does attrition vary across age groups and genders?
- How do promotion rates impact employee loyalty?
- Which job roles experience the highest attrition, and why?
- Does performance level influence an employee’s likelihood to exit?
- Are certain educational backgrounds more prone to attrition?

### Results/Findings
Some of the Analysis results are summarised as follows;
1. The company recorded the highest staff attrition among employees within the 26–35 age bracket.
2. Male employees accounted for a higher attrition rate compared to female employees.
3. The Research and Development (R&D) department experienced the highest level of employee attrition.
4. Attrition rates decreased as employee qualification levels increased.

### Recomendations
* Develop structured career growth and mentorship programs for employees aged 26–35.
* Implement targeted engagement and motivation initiatives for male employees.
* Improve workload management, support systems, and incentives in the R&D department.
* Conduct regular stay interviews and analyze exit feedback to address retention issues early.
